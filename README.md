A mini-project where I analyzed network traffic using Wireshark, extracted IPs, and mapped their locations using Google Earth (KML). This provides a visual representation of network connections and helps in understanding network traffic flow!



Wireshark for packet capture

Python (dpkt, pygeoip, socket) for packet analysis 

Google Earth (KML) for visualization
