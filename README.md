# 📡 Network Tracking using Wireshark & Google Maps  

🚀 A **mini-project** that captures network traffic, extracts IP addresses, and maps them on **Google Earth** using **KML files**. This project helps visualize network connections and analyze network traffic patterns.  

![Google Earth KML Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Google_Earth.jpg)  
*Example visualization (replace with actual screenshots from your project)*  

## 🔍 Features  
✅ Extracts **source and destination IPs** from captured packets  
✅ Uses **GeoIP** lookup to fetch location data  
✅ Generates a **KML file** to visualize network connections on **Google Earth**  
✅ Helps in **cybersecurity analysis**, **network monitoring**, and **forensics**  

## 📂 Project Structure  
```
├── GeoLiteCity.dat      # GeoIP database (Download separately)
├── wire.pcap            # Sample packet capture file
├── network_tracker.py   # Main Python script
├── output.kml           # Generated KML file for visualization
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
Make sure you have Python installed, then install required libraries:  
```bash
pip install dpkt pygeoip
```

### 2️⃣ Download GeoLiteCity Database  
This project uses **GeoLiteCity.dat** for IP geolocation.  
🔹 Download it from: [MaxMind GeoLite Legacy Database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/)  
🔹 Place it in the same directory as the script.  

### 3️⃣ Run the Script  
```bash
python network_tracker.py
```
This will generate an **output.kml** file.

### 4️⃣ Open in Google Earth 🌍  
- Open **Google Earth**  
- Import `output.kml`  
- See network traffic locations on the map!  

## 🏭 Industry Use Cases  
🔹 **Cybersecurity:** Identify and track malicious IPs 📡  
🔹 **Network Monitoring:** Visualize traffic sources and destinations 📊  
🔹 **Forensic Analysis:** Trace network intrusions & attack origins 🔍  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
🔹 **Real-time packet capture** instead of `.pcap` files  
🔹 **Automated security alerts** for suspicious traffic  
🔹 **Machine learning-based anomaly detection**
